# Change Review Protocol

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-03
**Purpose:** Comprehensive code review before creating test plan or pull request

---

## Trigger Phrases

- "review my changes"
- "code review"
- "review this change"
- "check my work"

---

## Overview

This protocol performs a comprehensive review of code changes, ensuring quality, security, and completeness before proceeding to test planning or pull request creation.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Feature documentation must exist in `docs/notes/`
- [ ] Changes committed or staged in git
- [ ] On a feature/bug branch (not main/master)

**If Prerequisites Not Met:**
```
PREREQUISITE MISSING

Feature documentation not found in docs/notes/

Please create documentation first using:
- "create documentation" or
- "start work on {work item number}"

Cannot proceed with code review without documentation.
```

---

## Protocol Steps

### Step 1: Verify Documentation Exists

**Actions:**
- [ ] Search for feature documentation in `docs/notes/`
- [ ] Verify documentation matches current branch/feature
- [ ] Fail if documentation not found

---

### Step 2: Analyze Git Status

**Actions:**
- [ ] Get current branch name
- [ ] List all changed files (staged and unstaged)
- [ ] Identify commit history on branch
- [ ] Note any untracked files

**Commands:**
```bash
# Current branch
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD

# Changed files
git status --short

# Recent commits on branch
git log --oneline -10

# Diff summary
git diff --stat HEAD~{n}
```

---

### Step 3: Extract Work Item Information

**Actions:**
- [ ] Extract work item number from branch name
- [ ] Fetch work item details (if tracking configured)
- [ ] Compare implementation to acceptance criteria

---

### Step 4: Review Code Changes

**For Each Changed File:**

1. **Read the file** - Understand the changes
2. **Check code quality:**
   - [ ] Follows existing patterns
   - [ ] Consistent naming conventions
   - [ ] Appropriate comments
   - [ ] No debug code left in
   - [ ] No hardcoded values

3. **Check security:**
   - [ ] No secrets in code
   - [ ] Input validation present
   - [ ] Authorization checks in place
   - [ ] SQL injection prevention
   - [ ] XSS prevention

4. **Check completeness:**
   - [ ] All acceptance criteria addressed
   - [ ] Error handling complete
   - [ ] Edge cases handled
   - [ ] Unit tests added/updated

---

### Step 5: Search for Missed Changes

**Actions:**
- [ ] Search codebase for similar patterns that might need same fix
- [ ] Check for copy-pasted code that needs updating
- [ ] Verify all components affected are updated
- [ ] Check configuration files if needed

**Search Patterns:**
```bash
# Find similar patterns
grep -r "pattern" --include="*.{cs,ts,js,py}"

# Find related files
find . -name "*Related*" -type f
```

---

### Step 6: Check Test Coverage

**Actions:**
- [ ] Identify existing tests for modified code
- [ ] Verify tests still pass
- [ ] Note areas lacking test coverage
- [ ] Check for integration test needs

---

### Step 7: Review Dependencies

**Actions:**
- [ ] Check for new dependencies added
- [ ] Verify version compatibility
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Note license implications

---

### Step 8: Generate Change Review Summary

**Add to Feature Documentation:**

```markdown
---

## Change Review Summary

**Review Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Branch:** `{branch-name}`
**Reviewer:** Claude Code

### Files Changed

| File                        | Change Type | Lines Changed |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| `path/to/file.cs`           | Modified    | +45, -12      |
| `path/to/new-file.cs`       | Added       | +120          |
| `path/to/deleted-file.cs`   | Deleted     | -50           |
