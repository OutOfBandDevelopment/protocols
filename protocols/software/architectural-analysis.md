# Architectural Analysis Protocol

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-03
**Purpose:** Standardized procedure for analyzing and documenting project architecture

---

## Overview

This protocol guides the systematic analysis of a project's architecture, ensuring consistent documentation, pattern identification, and cross-project insights. It produces structured documentation following the style guide while capturing both technical and organizational details.

## When to Use

- Initial architectural analysis of a project
- Periodic architecture reviews (quarterly recommended)
- After major architectural changes
- When onboarding new team members
- When identifying cross-project patterns

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Access to project repository
- [ ] Read access to source code
- [ ] [Documentation Style Guide Protocol](../documentation/documentation-style-guide.md) reviewed
- [ ] PlantUML rendering tools available
- [ ] Git command-line access

---

## Procedure

### Step 1: Capture Project Metadata

Record current state of the project for version tracking.

```bash
# Capture metadata
echo "Project: $(basename $(pwd))"
echo "Branch: $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
echo "Commit: $(git rev-parse HEAD)"
echo "Short Hash: $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
echo "Last Commit Date: $(git log -1 --format=%cd --date=short)"
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Branch name captured
- [ ] Full commit hash captured
- [ ] Short hash (7 chars) captured
- [ ] Last commit date captured

---

### Step 2: Create Documentation Directory

Create documentation directory for the project.

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir -p docs/{ProjectName}

# Create standard documentation files
touch docs/{ProjectName}/architecture.md
touch docs/{ProjectName}/patterns.md
touch docs/{ProjectName}/README.md
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Project directory created under `docs/`
- [ ] Three standard files created (architecture.md, patterns.md, README.md)

---

### Step 3: Initial Discovery - Project Structure

Explore the project to understand its organization.

**3.1: Identify Build System**

Look for solution files, project files, package management.

**3.2: Identify Key Directories**

Map the top-level structure (src/, test/, docs/, etc.)

**3.3: Identify Documentation**

Find existing README.md, CLAUDE.md, and other documentation.

**Validation:**
- [ ] Build system identified
- [ ] Project count estimated
- [ ] Directory structure mapped
- [ ] Existing documentation cataloged

---

### Step 4: Analyze Architecture

Perform systematic architectural analysis.

**4.1: Technology Stack**

Document in `technologies.md`:

```markdown
# Technologies - [ProjectName]

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Reference:** `{ProjectName}` @ `{branch}` (`{commit-hash}`)

## Programming Languages
- [Language] [Version]

## Frameworks
- [Framework] [Version]

## Key Libraries
| Library | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| [Name] | [Ver] | [Purpose] |

## Build Tools
- [Tool] [Version]

## Testing Frameworks
- [Framework] [Version]

## Data Storage
- [Database/Format] [Version]

## UI Framework
- [Framework] [Version]
```

**4.2: System Architecture**

Identify architectural layers and components:
- Presentation layer (UI)
- Application layer (business logic)
- Domain layer (domain models)
- Infrastructure layer (data access, external systems)

**4.3: Key Design Decisions**

Look for:
- Dependency injection setup
- Configuration management
- Error handling strategies
- Logging approach
- Testing strategy

**Validation:**
- [ ] Technology stack documented
- [ ] Architectural layers identified
- [ ] Key libraries cataloged
- [ ] Design decisions noted

---

### Step 5: Create C4 Context Diagram

Add C4 Context diagram directly in the architecture markdown file.

```markdown
## System Context

```plantuml
@startuml
'title: C4 Context Diagram - [ProjectName]
'version: 1.0
'date: YYYY-MM-DD
'reference: {ProjectName} @ {branch} ({commit-hash})

!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Context.puml

LAYOUT_WITH_LEGEND()

'Define primary actors/users
Person(user, "[User Role]", "[Description]")

'Define this system
System(system, "[ProjectName]", "[Purpose]")

'Define external systems
System_Ext(external1, "[External System]", "[Description]")

'Define relationships
Rel(user, system, "[Action]", "[Protocol/Tech]")
Rel(system, external1, "[Action]", "[Protocol/Tech]")

@enduml
```
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Diagram embedded in architecture file
- [ ] All external dependencies identified
- [ ] User actors defined
- [ ] Relationships labeled with protocols/technologies

---

### Step 6: Create C4 Container Diagram

Add C4 Container diagram showing major containers.

**Validation:**
- [ ] Major containers identified (applications, services, databases)
- [ ] Technology stack labeled for each container
- [ ] Inter-container relationships documented

---

### Step 7: Identify and Document Patterns

Analyze code for patterns and practices.

**7.1: Code Organization Patterns**

Look for common folder structures (Models, ViewModels, Views, Services, etc.)

**7.2: Design Patterns**

Look for evidence of:
- Repository pattern
- Factory pattern
- Strategy pattern
- Observer/Event patterns
- MVVM pattern (for UI apps)
- Dependency Injection

**7.3: Testing Patterns**

Identify testing frameworks and organization.

Document findings in `patterns.md`:

```markdown
# Patterns and Practices - [ProjectName]

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Reference:** `{ProjectName}` @ `{branch}` (`{commit-hash}`)

## Pattern Name: [Pattern Name]

**Category:** [Architectural | Design | Code Organization | Testing]
**Confidence:** [High | Medium | Low]
**Evidence:** [File references]

### Intent
[What problem does this solve?]

### Implementation
[How is it implemented? Include code references with line numbers]

### Example
```language
[Code snippet with file reference]
```

### Benefits

- [Drawback 1]
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] At least 3 patterns identified and documented
- [ ] Code examples include file references
- [ ] Confidence level assessed
