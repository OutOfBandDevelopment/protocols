## When to Use

- After completing architectural analysis
- During documentation reviews

## Evidence Collection Requirements

### Code References

Every claim must have a code reference:
```markdown
**Feature:** [Name]
**File:** `path/to/file.cs:123-145`
**Evidence:** [Specific code or configuration that proves the claim]
```

### Field Mapping Tables

For data architecture:
| UI Field | ViewModel Property | Domain Property | DB Column | API Field |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| [Label] | [Property] | [Property] | [Column] | [Field] |

### UI Layouts (SALT Diagrams)

For UI documentation:
```plantuml
@startsalt
{
  {T
    + Window Title
    ++ Menu Bar
    +++ File | Edit | View
    ++ Toolbar
    ++ Main Content
    +++ List Panel | Detail Panel
    ++ Status Bar
  }
}
@endsalt
```

## Completeness Scoring

Rate each dimension:

| Dimension | Complete | Partial | Missing |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| Technical Architecture | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Design Patterns | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| User Experience | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Security & Compliance | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Data Architecture | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Operations & Support | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
